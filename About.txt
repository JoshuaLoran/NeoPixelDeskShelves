I built these Neopixel desk shelves for my girlfriend. I didn't realize that I was going to put in so many buttons initially,
but my girlfriend kept wanting to add more color bottons. So, more color bottons it was! She would pick a color, and I would 
gather the RGB values.

She also wanted a cool rainbow effect, so I spliced in some code from the adafruit examples and made a few tweaks. I also 
wrote some holiday effects from scratch, but I'm having an issue after returning from both these methods that causes the next
value to have to be input twice to switch to the desired color/pattern.
